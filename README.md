# First Ever GitHub Page!

This is the first ever GitHub page that I have made! I had a lot of fun learning how to make
it and manage everything on GitHub.

This page is hosted at [adamcrayton.github.io](adamcrayton.github.io)

## About Me:
My name is Adam Crayton and I am a Comp Sci Major here at Boise State! I am spending my summer
working at a Game Company as a Unit Tester Developer and even more! I'm super excited to continue this
during the summer.
